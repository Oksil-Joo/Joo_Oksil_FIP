This is Oksilâ€™s final integrated assignment. I create a five-page website based on the HTML/CSS/JAVA Script. The work is responsible for designing, coding, and semantically tagging a responsive HTML5 website. The theme of my website is **BALLA Beer**. The inspiration for my creation comes from Alexander Keith's beer, which is one of Canada's top 10 favorite brands. Initially, I created a Balla logo, and then I built a style guide and packaging with created it. I created a three-beer bottle and cans using Cinema 4d, I made an advertisement video using After effects.
